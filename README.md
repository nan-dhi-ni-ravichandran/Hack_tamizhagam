Road safety remains a critical issue worldwide, particularly in urban areas where traffic
congestion, rapid infrastructure development, and environmental factors contribute to road
hazards such as potholes, malfunctioning traffic signals, and poorly designed intersections. To
address these challenges, a Community Reporting System for Road Hazards has been

developed, empowering citizens to actively participate in improving road safety. This web-
based platform offers a user-friendly interface for the general public, allowing them to report

hazards in real-time through their smartphones or computers. Users can fill out a simple form
to provide details such as the type of hazard (e.g., potholes, broken traffic signals), its exact
location, a description of the issue, and even upload images for better clarity. Once submitted,
the data is stored in a centralized database, which is accessible to both the public and relevant
authorities.
For administrators, the system provides a comprehensive dashboard designed to streamline the
management of reported hazards. The dashboard allows authorities to review submitted reports,
update their status (e.g., "Under Review," "Resolved"), and prioritize actions based on the
severity of the issue. Administrators can also generate analytical reports to identify recurring
problems and allocate resources more effectively. The public, on the other hand, can track the
status of their reported hazards through a public-facing interface, ensuring transparency and
fostering trust in the system. Notifications are sent to users whenever there is an update on their
reports, keeping them informed throughout the resolution process.
